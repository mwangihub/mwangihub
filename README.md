# Hi, Iâ€™m Peter Mwangi


I am a python software developer. I Create web applications using Django, JS, CSS and other technology.
Since 2015 i have been learning django and other python tecnologies to build modern web and mobile applications.
I like making the community look better by providing technical solutions.

I am always trying to grow and learn something new everyday. On my free time i like nature walk, gym, reading books and jogging.

### My focus
As much as i like Django technology and how it intergrates well with React and React native, I am also currently learning AI 
and willing to participate in any team with similar goals.
