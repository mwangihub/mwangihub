# Hi, Iâ€™m Peter Mwangi

I am a dedicated Python software developer specializing in web application development using Django, JS, CSS, and various other technologies. With a strong foundation in Django since 2015, I have continuously expanded my expertise in Python to create modern web and mobile applications. I take pride in enhancing the community by offering technical solutions that contribute to its improvement.

Driven by a passion for growth and learning, I actively seek opportunities to broaden my knowledge and acquire new skills each day. While I have a profound appreciation for the seamless integration of Django with React and React Native, I am also currently immersing myself in the field of AI. I am eager to join a team that shares similar goals and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of innovation.
